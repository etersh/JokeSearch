# Programmer Joke Search Website

This repository contains the files for the Joke Search website, created during freeCodeCamp's ["ASP.NET Core Crash Course - C# App in One Hour"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEjDD8mWYg) course on Youtube.

## Description

The Joke Search website is a simple web database app developed using C# and ASP.NET. The primary purpose of the website is to display programmer jokes, offering a search function and a user log-in feature.

This project is my initial attempt at building a C#/ASP.NET website, and I totally enjoyed the process of learning a new technology stack ðŸ˜¸

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Designed and implemented using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, facilitating clear separation of concerns.
  
- **Database Integration**: Used SQL Server as the backend database to store and manage the programmer jokes.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific programmer jokes, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Logged-in users have the ability to create, edit, and delete jokes, while unauthorized users are restricted from performing these actions.
